chealpy is the Python binding of chealpix.

  chealpix is the C implementation of HealPix.
  HealPix linearizes spherical coordinate into integers.

  You will need numpy > 1.6.
  
  The installation is just 
    python setup.py install

  Refer to HealPix manual for usage.

  Two precisions are provided:
    chealpy.high :upto nside=1<<29
    chealpy.low : upto nside=8192

  functions under the namespace chealpy are imported from chealpy.high

  MAX_NSIDES is the upper limit of nsides

  wrappers are automatically generated Cython code, making use 
  of NpyIter API.

  For a feature-rich Healpix C++ binding, take a look at healpy.
